- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that honey never spoils? Archaeologists have found pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3,000 years old and still perfectly edible. Honey's unique chemical composition, low moisture content, and acidity create an inhospitable environment for bacteria and microorganisms, allowing it to remain preserved indefinitely. So, next time you're enjoying a spoonful of honey, you're tasting a food that has been enjoyed for millennia!
